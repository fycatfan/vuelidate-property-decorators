# vuelidate-property-decorators example

This example shows how to set up and use ``vuelidate-property-decorators``.
It was generated by standard vue client (``vue create example``) and then the
following changes were made:

1. Changed ``babel.config.js`` to use legacy decorators (required by ``vue-property-decorator``)
2. yarn add ``vue-property-decorator`` ``vuelidate-property-decorators``
3. Renamed ``HelloWorld`` to ``VuelidateTest``, changed to class-based vue component
   and added vuelidate example into this component

## Project setup

yarn install
```

### To try
